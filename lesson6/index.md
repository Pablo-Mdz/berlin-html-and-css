# HTML Tags 3

This session teaches HTML Tags that go beyond the scope of our CV Project website. The exercises could still use the content of checkpoint 5 but at the end of the lesson, there should be no new content added to the CV Website. In other words, there is no checkpoint 6 but we would instead use checkpoint 5 in the beginning of lesson 7.

> If a student insists that they use a certain HTML Tag which they learnt during this lesson, then they can still add it to their personal CV website but the general content at the beginning of lesson 7 should be the content from checkpoint 5.

## Class Agenda

1. HTML Tables
2. HTML Multimedia
3. HTML Entities
4. Other HTML Tags

## 1. HTML Tables

This section teaches students how to do an HTML table without doing any CSS improvements. The section covers:

- How can we do a table in HTML?
- How do we define the number of rows?
- How do we define the number of columns
- How do we make cell span multiple columns / rows via the `rowspan`, `columnspan` attributes?
- How do we add `<caption>` to tables?

ETA: 40min

## 2. HTML Multimedia

Students should learn about basic HTML Multimedia and how to embed such in their website without the need for using any JavaScript. This section covers:

- What HTML Multimedia is?
- What are the different and most common file formats for multimedia (e.g. video and audio)
- How to create an HTML `<video>` and what are the attributes we can use there?
- How to create an HTML `<audio>` and what are the attributes we can use there?

ETA: 30min

## 3. HTML Entities

This section should explain how to add html [character entities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) and what their purpose is. In short, character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML. These include:

- non breaking space
- less than `<`
- greater than `>`
- ampersand `&`
- single quotation mark `'`
- double quotation mark `"`
- and others such as euro, cent, pound, yen, etc.

ETA: 15mins

# 4. Other HTML Tags

This section covers various HTML tags which are less famous but good to keep in mind. These include

- `<meter>`
- `<progress>`
- `<cite>`
- `<blockquote>`
- `<bdi>` and `<bdo>`
- `<details>` with `<summary>`
- `<address>`
- `<abbr>`
- `<hgroup>`

ETA: 25min

# Exercise Description

Exercises should be done along while explaining the tags.

This lesson does not add any new content to our project because the information taught in the lecture does not strictly relate to the CV website.

Therefore, Checkpoint 5 will be used in the beginning of lesson 7.

# Glossary & Terminology

- `HTML Entity` - An HTML Entity is a sequence of characters that produce a single output character in the HTML. Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML. For example, `<` and `>` are reserved characters and a developer cannot put these inside their HTML unless the developer uses an HTML Entity. More on this can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp).
- `Multimedia` - Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations. More on this can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_media.asp)
