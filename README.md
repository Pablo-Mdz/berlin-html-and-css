# Welcome to HTML & CSS course of NRW (2021 Spring)

In this course we will learn how websites are made and teach you how to build your own.

Note this website uses Just The Docs, a well-known Jekyll theme, customized with ReDI colors and logos.

For instuctions and examples of what the theme can do, and how you can do the
same in your course pages, please see: https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs

# Teaching Concepts

## Checkpoints
In the course, each student will be working on a personal portfolio website (or project).
This project is the way to show that you are following the topics taught in class.
Checkpoints are stages of work that use topics you are taught in class to achieve a small part of the project.

### How to find Checkpoint for a Lesson (For students)
- Visit the course's [GitHub page](https://github.com/ReDI-School/nrw-html-and-css-2021-spring). You should see something similar to the screenshot below.
- Click on the Branch dropdown (shown in the screenshot)

- In the dropdown, select a checkpoint branch that matches the lesson you want to see. For example, if you want to see the Checkpoint for Lesson 8, select "checkpoint8" branch. Note that not all Lessons have a corresponding checkpoint branch.

- Once you select a checkpoint branch, you will see a folder named "checkpoint". This folder contains the checkpoint files you are looking for.
