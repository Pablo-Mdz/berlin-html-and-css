## 1. HTML Structure

"At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document". [[1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)]

HTML is composed of elements. e.g a paragraph element looks like:

```
<p>Hello world!</p>
```

  - VS Code
  - [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
  - Browser (Google Chrome)
