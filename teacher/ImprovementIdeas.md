# Ideas

Here are some general improvement ideas that we could introduce for our HTML & CSS course. We might need more time to tackle these so maybe we should do this in between semesters.

- Using Github Classrooms as a way to manage student's assignments, homework, exercises, etc. (Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXWXg68KpTY)
- Measuring somehow students motivation in the first classes
- Assigning experienced teachers for the first few classes so that we spark the motivation and joy in students.
- I recommend that we use an Online Code Editor like [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) in class for students to write code. It is easier for the teacher to see their progress in real time that way compared to screen sharing. (Seun)
