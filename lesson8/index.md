# Session Title

## Class Agenda

Content Proposal for lesson 8 (Intro to CSS) - (although not part of this PR)
We can follow the [W3Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) which I find good enough

1. Recap of CSS Intro (from [lesson 2](https://redi-school.github.io/nrw-html-and-css-2021-spring/lesson2/#2-introduction-to-css)) -> ETA: 10mins
2. CSS Syntax -> ETA 10-15min
3. CSS Selectors I -> ETA 40 min

- Categorization of the different selector groups as per W3S
- Teaching Students the simple CSS Selector group (first of the five) as shown [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp) . That includes (element, class, id, universal and grouping selectors)

> My idea is that in some other lesson down the course we have a section called `CSS Selectors ||` which covers advanced CSS Selectors (the rest 4 out of 5 groups) 4. How to add CSS to HTML -> ETA 40 mins

- explaining the different ways to add css as per [W3S](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) and also provide the differences / pros and cons
- Teach the cascading order? What is the CSS Specificity order?
- Also what happens if two identical css rules (with different values) are applied to the same one.

Exercise:

- PRactice adding CSS to html via the different selectors and via the different integration methods. Students should not learn about CSS rules in this course, they should rather use a simple `{background: red}` rule, for example to learn selectors and html integration

Homework:

- We can ask them to use one inline, one class , one element, one id class and so on in their CV (with background red). We can again show them an image of what we want to achieve
