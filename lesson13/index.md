## 1. Normal Flow

This section will help the students to understand how webpage elements are laid out by default.

- Last class introduced the idea that everything on the page is a box.
- By default, these boxes can be stacked up on top of one another, or side by side
- Revision: What does block level and inline elements mean?


## 2. The `display` Property

You can change how elements behave in normal flow with the `display` property.

Exercise:
1. Apply a border on all elements on your page.
2. Using the dev tools, identify elements with display block and change them to inline (and vice versa)
3. Observe how the flow of elements on the page changes


## 3. Floats

- The CSS float property specifies how an element should float. It helps to wrap text around images.
- values for the Float property `"left", "right", "none", "inherit"`
