## 1. Welcome & Student Introduction

This is the first lesson in our HTML & CSS course. We would like to use this opportunity to build a stronger relationship between teachers and students, and also among students themselves. Students could each present themselves for around 3 minutes. Good questions to get to know people are:

- Could you shortly describe yourself?
- How is your name pronounced? How would you like to be called?
- What are your interests in your free time?
- What inspires you about tech? Did you have any technical background?
- What do you expect from this course?

ETA: ~50min

## 2. Organizational

In this section we would like to cover the organizational topics around our course. This includes:

- Presentation of the website we have - <https://redi-school.github.io/nrw-html-and-css/lesson1//>
- The framework of lesson notes
  - Class Agenda
  - Content Sections
  - Exercise Description
  - Glossary & Terminology
  - Homework
  - Resources
- The use cases for lesson notes: studying in advance or looking back at past material

Apart from that we would like to describe the process of feedback and homework checks.

- We usually do not check homework but we encourage people to do it.
- Once some homework task is done students can share and compare with each other via the Classroom channel which is highly advised. You learn the most through sharing!
- If students would like they can also consult with a teacher via the Classroom channel. We would try responding in timely manner.

ETA: 10min

## 3. Project Website

The practical part of this course is covered by a project which is built throughout the whole semester in parallel to the lessons. The project is about building an own personal website. The website is a personal portfolio (CV) website built with HTML & CSS only.

Example CV Websites:

- <https://www.sesanosanyinbi.com/>
- <https://ethanmarcotte.com/>
- <https://laurieontech.com/>
- <https://rachelandrew.co.uk/>
- Example of the checkpoint website
- An example [student website](https://julietchuks.github.io/Portfolio/) presented during the [demo day](https://youtu.be/upP5NuMLCGU?t=146) in 2020 Spring semester
